# BioSynCortex – Teaching LLMs to See Bioinformatics

## The Future of AI in Bioinformatics

In the 1960s, scientists foresaw a world where robots would play a crucial role in society. To help them navigate this future, they designed the OCR-A font—a machine-readable typeface that empowered optical character recogniti`on (OCR) systems to coexist with humans in a visually rich world.

Today, we face a similar challenge. Human researchers rely on powerful visual-spatial reasoning to interpret scientific data, effortlessly drawing insights from plots like UMAPs, volcano plots, and violin plots in single-cell bioinformatics. Yet, large language models (LLMs), despite their linguistic prowess, remain blind to these essential representations of biological data.

## What We’re Building

BioSynCortex (Biological Synthesis Cortex) is an initiative under OpenTechBio dedicated to bridging this gap. Inspired by the way the human visual cortex processes information, we aim to:

1.	Create new data representations optimized for LLMs, enabling them to parse and reason about biological visualizations.

2.	Develop transformation models to convert existing plots into representations that LLMs can understand and utilize.

Through these efforts, we hope to bring LLM agents into bioinformatics—not just as tools, but as future collaborators capable of interpreting and reasoning about biological data as we do.
